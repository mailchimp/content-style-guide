MailChimp blog posts are written by people from all over the company, not just those with “writer” in their job title. We love having in-office experts blog about their work. The person with the knowledge is best able to convey it, and the content team can help by brainstorming and editing them as needed.

Several blogs exist under the MailChimp umbrella. We have a few for specific departments, including our [design](http://creative.mailchimp.com), [engineering](http://devs.mailchimp.com/blog/), and [technical content](http://docmakers.mailchimp.com) teams. This section will focus on the main [MailChimp marketing blog](http://blog.mailchimp.com), but these guidelines apply to the other channels, too.

## Basics 

We update the main MailChimp blog a couple times every week. We generally publish:

* Feature, release, and integration announcements
* MailChimp user case studies
* Instructive tips and tricks for small businesses
* Examples of how we use MailChimp’s features in our own marketing

We publish blog posts that explain the "why" behind the work we do at MailChimp. We want to demonstrate the ways in which we're an industry leader with the best products, and we want to tell the stories behind those products. 

## Guidelines

When writing for the blog, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](TK) and [Grammar and mechanics](TK) sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

### Be casual, but smart
This isn’t a term paper, so there’s no need to be stuffy. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language. 

### Be specific
If you're writing about data, put the numbers in context. If you're writing about a MailChimp customer, give the reader plenty of information about the company's stage, workflow, results, and values.

### Get to the point
Get to the important stuff right away, and don’t bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheads. Our users are busy, and we should always keep that in mind.

### Links
Feel free to link away from MailChimp if it helps you explain something.

### LOL
MailChimp is a fun company, and we want our blog to reflect this. Feel free to throw in a joke here and there, or link out to a funny .GIF or YouTube video when appropriate. Just don't overdo it.

### Tags
In WordPress, add keywords that apply to your article. Look through existing posts for common tags. If you’re not sure if a word should be a tag, it probably shouldn’t.

### Use pictures
Include images in your blog posts when it makes sense. If you’re explaining how to use MailChimp, include screenshots to illustrate your point. When posting to WordPress, remove image links, or link the image to the relevant URL. Make sure to use alt text.
