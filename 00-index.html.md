# Welcome to the Mews Microcopy Style Guide

This style guide was created for Mews employees, but we hope it’s helpful for other organizations that may produce similar content.

## For all our Mewsers

You've found the Mews Product and Technical style guide for UX Writing and Microcopy. It helps us write clear and consistent content across all Mews Products. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing any content for Mews products

Ths guide includes basic grammar, style points, and so much more. We'll also cover internal structure for organization, and our procedures for writing new messages in each of our beloved products.

We’ve divided the guide by topic, product type (B2B and B2C), and the different types of content we publish. Feel free to reference the guide as needed or browse in order.

## Kudos to Mailchimp

We have edited this guide to fit the needs of Mews Systems and our teams, but the structure of this style guide was originally created by Mailchimp.
