This style guide was created for Urbanist Architecture employees. It is based on MailChimp's open source style guide.

## Brief Introduction

Welcome to Urbanist Architecture's style guide! Using this as a reference, we can create clear and consistent content across all channels. 

You may use this guide to answer any grammar or style questions. But more than that, this guide can help the firm craft a singular voice and brand.

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order. The entire guide is searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for.
