# Welcome to the Mews Microcopy Style Guide

This style guide was created for Mews employees, but we hope it’s helpful for other organizations that may produce similar content.

## For all our Mewsers

You've found the Mews Product and Technical style guide for UX Writing and Microcopy. It helps us write clear and consistent content across all Mews Products. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing any content for Mews products

Ths guide includes basic grammar and style points, but there's so much more. It will additionally cover internal structure for organization, and a detailed procedure for writing messages used for each of our beloved products, both B2B and B2C. 

We’ve divided the guide by topic and product type. There are also guides about the different types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order.

## Kudos to Mailchimp
