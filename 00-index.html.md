# Welcome to the Mews UX Writing Style Guide

This style guide was created for Mews employees, but we hope it’s helpful for other organizations that may have similar products or may produce similar content.

## For all our Mewsers

You've found the Mews Product and Technical style guide for UX Writing and Microcopy. It helps us write clear and consistent content across all Mews Products. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing any content for Mews products

Ths guide starts at basic grammar and style points, but includes much more. It will additionally contain internal structure for organization, and detailed procedure for writing messages for all products, both B2B and B2C. Grammar is, of course, very important. However, the primary goal in our writing is clarity. 

We’ve divided the guide by topic, product type, and based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order.
