This style guide was created for Urbanist Architecture employees. It is based on MailChimp's open source style guide.

## Brief Introduction

This is our company style guide. It helps us write clear and consistent content across teams and channels. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing for Urbanist Architecture.

This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. It is also about tone of voice and brand.

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order. The entire guide is searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for.
